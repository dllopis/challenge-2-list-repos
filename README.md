# Codecorgi-Challenge-2-List-Repos
This site displays the github repos for a given user
sorted by recency.

# My working Proto-type
https://codecorgi-challenge-1-functional-prototype.netlify.com/

# Current Issues:
      * use my own html format instead of the boiler-plate provided
      * display repos by recency
      * error catching
      * refactor and break up app.js
      * ~~repo content is updating and keeping previous user repos~~
      * ~~implement on key press event for button (Enter)~~
      * keydown spams submit form (caused a rate-limit issue for API)

Feel free to update this list, so that I can fix any issues.

# Improvements:
      * key press feature implemented (can hit Enter in form to fetch data)
      * fixed issue with repo's html content appearing consecutively when searching for another user
