# Codecorgi-Challenge-2-List-Repos
This site displays the github repos for a given user
sorted by recency.

# My working Proto-type
https://codecorgi-challenge-1-functional-prototype.netlify.com/
---
# Issues:
      * use my own html format instead of the boiler-plate provided
      * display repos by recency
      * error catching on invalid input like 404
      * refactor and break up app.js
      * keydown spams submit form (caused a rate-limit issue for API)
Feel free to update this list, so that I can fix any issues.
      
# Fixes:  
     * Repo content is updating and keeping previous user repos
     * Key press for forms will work. (Press Enter instead of clicking button)
